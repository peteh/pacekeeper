# Superunner

Research for Superun walkpad.

## Start without WiFi and App account

 You'll get the remote with it, it'll have +, - and play/pause buttons. However, when you turn it on, it just reacts with a long annoying sound to any button press. When you turn it on with the power button, it will also take a while before showing the display info, first turning on all the segments.

That's where you strike!

You turn it on, and quickly press (+); you will be greeted with a short sound. Then you press: -, -, -, +, +, then wait 20s, turn it off and on again - should now display something else and you can start using it.
Sequence:

* Turn on with power button
* 3x -
* 1x +
* 1x + for 3s

Each good input will be confirmed by a short happy sound. Each wrong input will be confirmed by a long annyoing sound.
